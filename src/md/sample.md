# Markdown For xve

## Overview

**Markdown** is created by [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/); the original guideline is [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Its syntax, however, varies between different parsers or editors.

## Block Elements

### Paragraph and line breaks

A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text. In markdown source code, paragraphs are separated by two or more blank lines. In Typora, you only need one blank line (press `Return` once) to create a new paragraph.

Press `Shift` + `Return` to create a single line break. Most other markdown parsers will ignore single line breaks, so in order to make other markdown parsers recognize your line break, you can leave two spaces at the end of the line, or insert `<br/>`.

### Headers

Headers use 1-6 hash (`#`) characters at the start of the line, corresponding to header levels 1-6. For example:

``` markdown
# This is an H1

## This is an H2

###### This is an H6
```

In Typora, input ‘#’s followed by title content, and press `Return` key will create a header.

### Blockquotes

Markdown uses email-style > characters for block quoting. They are presented as:

``` markdown
> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. This is first paragraph.
>
> This is second pragraph. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.



> This is another blockquote with one paragraph. There is three empty line to seperate two blockquote.
```

In Typora, inputting ‘>’ followed by your quote contents will generate a quote block. Typora will insert a proper ‘>’ or line break for you. Nested block quotes (a block quote inside another block quote) by adding additional levels of ‘>’.

### Lists

Input `* list item 1` will create an unordered list - the `*` symbol can be replace with `+` or `-`.

Input `1. list item 1` will create an ordered list - their markdown source code is as follows:

``` markdown
## un-ordered list
*   Red
*   Green
*   Blue

## ordered list
1.  Red
2. 	Green
3.	Blue
```

### (Fenced) Code Blocks

Typora only supports fences in GitHub Flavored Markdown. Original code blocks in markdown are not supported.

Using fences is easy: Input \`\`\` and press `return`. Add an optional language identifier after \`\`\` and we'll run it through syntax highlighting:

``` markdown
Here's an example:

​```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
​```

syntax highlighting:
​```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
​```
```

### Tables

Input `| First Header  | Second Header |` and press the `return` key. This will create a table with two columns.

After a table is created, putting focus on that table will open up a toolbar for the table where you can resize, align, or delete the table. You can also use the context menu to copy and add/delete individual columns/rows.

The full syntax for tables is described below, but it is not necessary to know the full syntax in detail as the markdown source code for tables is generated automatically by Typora.

In markdown source code, they look like:

``` markdown
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
```

You can also include inline Markdown such as links, bold, italics, or strikethrough in the table.

Finally, by including colons (`:`) within the header row, you can define text in that column to be left-aligned, right-aligned, or center-aligned:

``` markdown
| Left-Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | some wordy text | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |    $1 |
```

A colon on the left-most side indicates a left-aligned column; a colon on the right-most side indicates a right-aligned column; a colon on both sides indicates a center-aligned column.

## Span Elements

Span elements will be parsed and rendered right after typing. Moving the cursor in middle of those span elements will expand those elements into markdown source. Below is an explanation of the syntax for each span element.

### Links

Markdown supports two styles of links: inline and reference.

In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].

To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text’s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses, put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an optional title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:

``` markdown
This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.

[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.
```

will produce:

This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link. (`<p>This is <a href="http://example.com/" title="Title">`)

[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute. (`<p><a href="http://example.net/">This link</a> has no`)

#### Internal Links

**You can set the href to headers**, which will create a bookmark that allow you to jump to that section after clicking. For example:

Command(on Windows: Ctrl) + Click [This link](#block-elements) will jump to header `Block Elements`. To see how to write that, please move cursor or click that link with `⌘` key pressed to expand the element into markdown source.

#### Reference Links

Reference-style links use a second set of square brackets, inside which you place a label of your choosing to identify the link:

``` markdown
This is [an example][id] reference-style link.

Then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label on a line by itself like this:

[id]: http://example.com/  "Optional Title Here"
```

In Typora, they will be rendered like so:

This is [an example][id] reference-style link.

[id]: http://example.com/	"Optional Title Here"

The implicit link name shortcut allows you to omit the name of the link, in which case the link text itself is used as the name. Just use an empty set of square brackets — for example, to link the word “Google” to the google.com web site, you could simply write:

``` markdown
[Google][]
And then define the link:

[Google]: http://google.com/
```

In Typora, clicking the link will expand it for editing, and command+click will open the hyperlink in your web browser.

### Images

Images have similar syntax as links, but they require an additional `!` char before the start of the link. The syntax for inserting an image looks like this:

``` markdown
![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)

![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")
```

You are able to use drag & drop to insert an image from an image file or your web browser. You can modify the markdown source code by clicking on the image. A relative path will be used if the image that is added using drag & drop is in same directory or sub-directory as the document you're currently editing.

### Emphasis

Markdown treats asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`) as indicators of emphasis. Text wrapped with one `*` or `_` will be wrapped with an HTML `<em>` tag. E.g:

``` markdown
*single asterisks*

_single underscores_
```

output:

*single asterisks*

_single underscores_

GFM will ignore underscores in words, which is commonly used in code and names, like this:

> wow_great_stuff
>
> do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing.

To produce a literal asterisk or underscore at a position where it would otherwise be used as an emphasis delimiter, you can backslash escape it:

``` markdown
\*this text is surrounded by literal asterisks\*
```

Typora recommends using the `*` symbol.

### Strong

A double `*` or `_` will cause its enclosed contents to be wrapped with an HTML `<strong>` tag, e.g:

``` markdown
**double asterisks**

__double underscores__
```

output:

**double asterisks**

__double underscores__

Typora recommends using the `**` symbol.

### Code

To indicate an inline span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph. For example:

``` markdown
Use the `printf()` function.
```

will produce:

Use the `printf()` function.

### Strikethrough

GFM adds syntax to create strikethrough text, which is missing from standard Markdown.

`~~Mistaken text.~~` becomes ~~Mistaken text.~~

## HTML

You can use HTML to style content what pure Markdown does not support. For example, use `<span style="color:red">this text is red</span>` to add text with red color.

### Embed Contents

Some websites provide iframe-based embed code which you can also paste into Typora. For example:

```Markdown
<iframe height='265' scrolling='no' title='Fancy Animated SVG Menu' src='http://codepen.io/jeangontijo/embed/OxVywj/?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=css,result&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'></iframe>
```

### Video

You can use the `<video>` HTML tag to embed videos. For example:

```Markdown
<video src="xxx.mp4" />
```

### Other HTML Support
